# Portfolio Tracker

A dashboard for managing a portfolio of projects and products across your areas of responsibility — with task tracking, stakeholder visibility, a focus feed, and an AI chat assistant that can act on your data. Built as a [Base44](https://base44.com) app (React frontend + Base44-hosted backend/entities).

## Overview

Portfolio Tracker is built for someone managing many projects and products across multiple areas of responsibility (e.g. "Work", "Home"). It organizes work into a three-level hierarchy and gives you a single dashboard to see status, risks, and priorities at a glance:

- **Areas of Responsibility** — the broadest grouping (e.g. Work, Home).
- **Products** — sit inside an area, optionally connected to related products.
- **Projects** — sit inside a product, or directly inside an area if there's no product. Each project owns a set of tasks.

Each level is rendered as a card, nested inside its parent's card, so the dashboard reads as a visual hierarchy rather than a flat list.

### Key features

- **Project cards** show a quadrant breakdown of task counts (Eisenhower-style: important/urgent), owner and due date (color-coded by commitment status), and open risks/questions — with an expandable detail view for the full picture (notes, stakeholders, metrics, attachments, links, custom fields).
- **Task table** per project with status, quadrant + H/Q flags, type, notes, stakeholders, and attachments. Tasks can be flagged as a weekly focus item or one of "today's top 3."
- **Product and Area cards** with their own expandable detail views, stakeholders, and support for user-defined custom fields (global or per-card, optionally surfaced on the card face).
- **Create New / Filter** — a single entry point to create a Task, Project, Product, or Area, plus filtering by area/product/project.
- **Right sidebar** — Today's Top 3, this week's focus items grouped by project, and a horizontal bar chart of task status counts per project.
- **Left sidebar** — stakeholders grouped by department, with per-category (tasks/notes/projects/products) counts that toggle a highlight/dim treatment across the dashboard.
- **AI chat assistant** — a floating chat widget (and a full `/chat` page) backed by a streaming LLM function that can create/update tasks, projects, products, and areas, add notes, mark focus items, and answer questions about your data, including archived items. The widget is a real draggable/resizable window (drag the header to move it, drag any edge or corner to resize) and remembers its position and size between sessions.
- **Archive view** — a date-range view of everything that was active during that window, including archived projects/tasks, which remain fully editable and can be restored.

### In-chat commands

Typing `/` as the first character of a chat message opens a command menu. Keep typing letters to filter it; the menu closes the moment you type anything that isn't a letter (a space, a comma, etc.), so a command is always a single word — after that, just keep typing your message normally. Select a suggestion with `↑`/`↓` + `Enter`/`Tab`, or click it.

If you send a `/word` that isn't one of the commands below, it's simply treated as plain text — no menu appears for it, and the assistant doesn't try to guess an action for it.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/task <description>` | Add a task to the active project |
| `/project <title>` | Create a new project |
| `/product <title>` | Create a new product |
| `/area <title>` | Create a new area of responsibility |
| `/note <text>` | Add a note to the active project |
| `/risk <text>` | Log a risk on the active project |
| `/question <text>` | Log an open question on the active project |
| `/stakeholder <name>` | Add a new stakeholder |
| `/status <task, new status>` | Change a task's status |
| `/top3 <task>` | Mark a task as one of today's top 3 |
| `/focus <task>` | Mark a task as this week's focus |
| `/help` | List all available slash commands |

The client-side list lives in `src/lib/chatCommands.js`; the matching server-side instructions (what each command maps to, and the "ignore anything not on this list" rule) live in `base44/functions/aiChatStream/entry.ts`.

## How it works

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite, React Router, TanStack Query for data fetching/caching, Zustand for lightweight client state, Tailwind CSS + Radix UI primitives (via `shadcn`-style components in `src/components/ui`) for the design system, Framer Motion for animation, and Recharts for the status bar chart.
- **Backend**: [Base44](https://base44.com) — a hosted backend providing entity storage/CRUD, auth, and serverless functions. The frontend talks to it through `@base44/sdk`, configured in `src/api/base44Client.js`.
- **Build tooling**: Vite with the `@base44/vite-plugin` (dev-only HMR notifier, visual-edit agent, and analytics hooks), ESLint, TypeScript in `checkJs` mode for type-checking JS via `jsconfig.json`, and Vitest for unit tests.

### Data model (`base44/entities`)

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Area` | Top-level area of responsibility; supports custom fields. |
| `Product` | Belongs to an `Area`; tracks stakeholders and related products. |
| `Project` | Belongs to a `Product` and/or `Area`; owns objective, due date, risks, metrics, archive state. |
| `Task` | Belongs to a `Project`; status, quadrant, type, focus/top-3 flags, archive state. |
| `ProjectNote` | Risk, open question, or general note attached to a project. |
| `Stakeholder` | Person with a name, department, and avatar; referenced by id across tasks/notes/projects/products. |
| `Department` | Grouping used to organize stakeholders in the left sidebar. |
| `ChatSession` / `ChatMessage` | AI assistant conversation history, paginated/lazy-loaded. |
| `User` | App user, with `admin`/`user` role. |

Soft-delete (`deleted_at`) and archive (`archived_at`/`is_archived`) fields are used throughout instead of hard deletes, so history is preserved for the archive view.

### Backend functions (`base44/functions`)

Serverless functions handle operations that go beyond simple entity CRUD: `aiChatStream` (streams LLM responses and executes the actions it decides on), `archiveProject` / `restoreProject` / `archivedProjects`, `deleteArea` / `deleteProduct` / `deleteProject` / `deleteDepartment`, `renameDepartment`, and `toggleTopThree`.

### Frontend structure (`src/`)

- `pages/` — top-level routes: `Dashboard`, `ChatPage`, auth pages (`Login`, `Register`, `ForgotPassword`, `ResetPassword`).
- `components/layout/` — app shell, header, and left/right sidebars.
- `components/areas/`, `components/products/`, `components/projects/` — the card + detail-modal pairs for each entity level.
- `components/sidebar/` — stakeholder list, focus feed, status chart.
- `components/ai/` — the floating chat widget, session history UI, and the `/` command menu (`ChatCommandMenu`).
- `components/modals/` — create/edit forms (`AreaForm`, `ProductForm`, `ProjectForm`, `TaskForm`, `CreateModal`, `FilterModal`).
- `components/archive/` — the archive date-range panel.
- `components/shared/` — cross-cutting UI (avatars, custom fields, stakeholder/product assignment, query error states).
- `hooks/` — data hooks per entity (`useProjects`, `useTasks`, `useProducts`, `useAreas`, `useStakeholders`, `useDepartments`, `useProjectNotes`) plus chat (`useChatController`, `useChatMessages`, `useChatSessions`, `useSlashCommand`), the chat widget's window geometry (`useWindowGeometry`), and other UI utility hooks.
- `lib/` — cross-cutting logic: auth context, filter/highlight context, entity and task utilities, the Base44 app-params/query-client setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Install the Base44 CLI: `npm install -g base44@latest`.

See the [Base44 CLI docs](https://docs.base44.com/developers/references/cli/get-started/overview) for direct CLI usage.

### Run locally (full stack)

```bash
base44 dev
```

This starts the local Base44 backend and, since this project's `base44/config.jsonc` sets `site.serveCommand` to `npm run dev`, also starts the Vite frontend. Use the URL it prints.

### Run frontend-only (against the hosted backend)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Point it at a hosted Base44 app by creating `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_BASE44_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_BASE44_APP_BASE_URL=https://your-app.base44.app
```

`base44 dev` injects these values automatically, so `.env.local` is mainly needed for frontend-only work.

### Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server (frontend only). |
| `npm run build` | Production build. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally. |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` | ESLint. |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check over JS via `jsconfig.json`. |
| `npm test` / `npm run test:watch` | Run the Vitest unit test suite (business logic in `src/lib` and `src/hooks`). |

### Publishing

Push your changes to git, then publish through the Base44 dashboard:

```bash
base44 dashboard open
```
